1.1	What is the return code for GET /home HTTP/1.1?

200 OK

1.2	What is the return code for GET /wiki HTTP/1.1?

302 FOUND

1.2.1	What is the next HTTP statement a browser would send after this 
return code?

The response contains a location field with value en.wikipedia.org.  The 
browser will send another GET request for the / directory in host 
en.wikipedia.org.  It would look something like:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: en.wikipedia.org

3.	What is the return code for PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1?

405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED

2.	Explain what happens when your browser loads 
http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/wiki from sending the 
request to loading HTML

The browser first makes an HTTP GET request for directory 
/~tmeyers/server/wiki on host people.ischool.berkeley.edu.  Berkeley’s 
proxy server runs ~tmeyers/server/app.py to determine the port to redirect 
the request to.  It finds port 63025, and redirects the request to 
localhost: 63025/wiki.  The response code is a 302 redirect, and the 
server resends a GET request to get the root folder located on host 
en.wikipedia.org.  The server generates an HTML file and returns it.  The 
browser parses the HTML file and makes additional GET requests for every 
file referenced in the HTML.  The browser renders the page using the 
received HTML, images, stylesheets and javascript files.

3.	What is the return code for 
http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/ ?

The request can be made using the following command: GET / HTTP/1.1.  The 
return code is: 404 NOT FOUND
