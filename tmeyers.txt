1) Your experience with web architecture.  Have you written HTML 
before?  Written Javascript? Etc.

I have experience developing web applications.  I developed several 
websites using PHP – some from scratch, some using the Zend Framework, and 
some based on Wordpress or Drupal.  I also developed ASP.NET and 
Silverlight applications, and have played around a bit with Ruby on Rails.  
I also have front-end development experience, including XHTML, CSS, 
Javascript, and JQuery.

2) What are your favorite features from at least two browsers?

Google Chrome:  I love how easy it is to add a web site to your favorites.  
In Internet Explorer for example, clicking the star is insufficient – you 
have to click “Add to Favorites” afterwards.  In Chrome, you just have to 
click the star once, then you have the option to undo.  I also love Chrome 
developer tools.  I use it to style my websites; I open my css file in it, 
and when editing it I can immediately see my styles in effect.

Firefox:  They have great plugins available.  For example, the Rank 
Checker plugin allows me to see the search engine ranking of each website 
I’m working on.  I also like Firebug for debugging Javascript.
