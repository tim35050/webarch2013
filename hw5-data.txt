1.	What HTTP command is used to make the /home resource respond with 
your full name (including spaces), the title of the page should be the 
full title of this class.

GET request.  See my changes here: 
http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~tmeyers/server/home

2.	Use a PUT request to set the redirect target of 
http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~tmeyers/server/wiki

PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 23
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

url=http://berkeley.edu
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 34
Server: Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3
Date: Thu, 03 Oct 2013 06:58:15 GMT

Stored wiki => http://berkeley.edu

I verify this change in two ways.  First, there is a confirmation message 
“Stored wiki => http://berkeley.edu that the server sends me, confirming 
that my url value was received and stored.  Second, when I navigate to 
http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~tmeyers/server/wiki, I am successfully 
redirected to http://berkeley.edu.

3. Use a POST to update the redirect target of 
http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/wiki to another new 
location.

POST /wiki HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 18
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

url=http://ted.com
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 29
Server: Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3

4.	Update app.py to correctly return an image from 
http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/i253
a.	Use your browser to test

It works!  http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~tmeyers/server/i253 shows 
an image with text “My friend Jim said i253 was fun”.

b.	Including the Content-Type in your submission

I uncommented and completed the following line in app.py:
resp.headers[‘Content-Type’] = ‘image/png’
