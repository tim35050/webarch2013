It is impossible for someone to see my partially-complete insert.  
That is because MySQL has the ACID properties, which include isolation.  
Isolation ensures that all queries to the database are 'isolated' such 
that people searching can't access the values of the people who are in the 
process of inserting.  Only after an insert is complete will those new 
values be accessible to everyone.  It is part of concurrency control, 
which prevents people from performing conflicting actions on the same 
database.
